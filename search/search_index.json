For example, when using Oh My Zsh, there is a folder named <code>custom</code> that contains your custom scripts, e.g. <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/path.zsh</code> This folder also contains <code>example.zsh</code>, which I do not want to be committed to my dotfiles repo. To include everything inside this path except <code>example.zsh</code>, your <code>.gitignore</code> has to look like this:</p> .gitignore<pre><code>/*                             # ignore all files in home\n!.oh-my-zsh/                   # but allow git to see the oh-my-zsh directory\n.oh-my-zsh/*                   # but ignore all files inside\n!.oh-my-zsh/custom/            # but allow git to see the custom directory\n.oh-my-zsh/custom/example.zsh  # but ignore example.zsh\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"dotfiles/#zsh-completion-for-your-custom-dotfiles-alias","title":"Zsh completion for Your Custom dotfiles alias","text":"<p>To get completion working for your setup (which contains an alias like <code>alias dotfiles='/usr/local/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'</code>), you need to enable <code>_git</code> completions for that command.
